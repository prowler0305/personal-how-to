# Workflow Strategies

With version control systems like Git it is important to understand how these source code control systems can be used to set a development model for the team or for a project. The two most popular development models using git are Git Flow and GitHub Flow. This page doesn't go into the detail specifics of each model as that is better served and explained in detail on the perspective sites.

[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

In summary the major difference is that a set of code that has different "releases" of the code deployed and supported at the same time or has multiple teams working on different parts at the same time usually benefits from the Git Flow model. While GitHub flow is a light weight version that is suited for code that is deployed on a Continuous Delivery schedule where the code contained in the master branch is always deployable.
