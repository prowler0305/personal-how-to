# USCC Engineering Github Organization
Under our GitHub Enterprise account we have a U.S. Cellular Engineering organization. This organization serves many purposes, but most importantly the ability to house all of our Automations being developed for the business in an environment gives us permission control. This allows us to bring in outside consultants and give them access to our GitHub Enterprise account for any development they do without giving them full access to any repositories that could contain sensitive information or code. To facilitate this we need to require everyone to create work related repositories under our organization. Below are the instructions on to request access as well as some useful links to documentation within Github about Organizations.

1. [Email Andrew Spear](mailto:Andrew.Spear@uscellular.com?subject=USCC%20Organization%20Request) and in the body of the email specify your GitHub username used to log into our GitHub Enterprise Account.
1. Once you have been added you will be able to access the organizations page. [Checkout the Github help doc](https://help.github.com/articles/accessing-an-organization/) to see how to get to it.
