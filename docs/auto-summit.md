# Analytics and Automation Summit #3

During this summit we are going to have a session topic on Git and Github explaining what they are, the role the play in software engineering, and they are different. The structure of this session will include some hands on trainging and interactions with Git and Github.

In preparations for this session so that you can follow along, we recommend accomplishing the following before the session:

1. [Request access to the U.S. Cellular Engineering Organization](uscc-organization.md)
1. Install IntelliJ Community Edition onto a system or in a way that you have administrative privileges. This is vital so that you have the authority to update and install plugins necessary to perform your work as an embedded software engineer.
1. [Generate and add an ssh key pair](generate-ssh-key.md) to your Github profile.
