# Analytics and Automation Summit #3

During this summit we are going to have a session topic on Git and Github explaining what they are, the role they can play in software engineering, and why they are different. The structure of this session will include some hands on training and interactions with Git and Github.

In preparation for this session so that you can follow along, we recommend accomplishing the following before the session:

1. [Request access to the U.S. Cellular Engineering Organization](uscc-organization.md)
1. Install Git and IntelliJ Community Edition onto a system in a way that you have administrative privileges. This is vital so that IntelliJ and Git has the authority to make hard drive changes as needed. 
1. [Generate and add an ssh key pair](generate-ssh-key.md) to your Github profile.

If you can't accomplish these tasks before the summit, don't worry. A lot of the material being covered is contained on this site for you to reference later.
