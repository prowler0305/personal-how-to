# Push changes to a Remote Repository
Pushing your commits is to simply take all your committed snapshots and copy them to a repository hosted on a remote server. This has a lot of benefits including the simple fact that the remote server keeps a backup of your repository that can be used to recover or access your files from anywhere.

In an IDE like IntelliJ you can accomplish by doing the following:
 
 1. On the main toolbar open the "VCS" menu and expand the "Git" and click "Push".
 
    [![VCS..Git..Push](/images/vcs_git_push.png)](/images/vcs_git_push.png)
    
 1. This brings up the "Commit Changes" dialog panel. By default specifies the remote origin master branch will be the receiver of the pushed commits.
