# How to create branches within a repository

Creating branches within a repository has many uses from allowing multiple developers to work on different parts of the code at the same time to being a part of a deployment strategy. For more information about the usefulness of branches please see the [Workflow Strategy]() page. This page will show the different ways you can create a branch in a repository.
