# Day to Day with Git

While there are a lot of commands which can seem to make using Git overwhelming, but day to day command usage can be narrowed down to a handful.

If using the Git command line interface (CLI) the command list day to day is about 4 commands.

* [Add](add_file.md)
* [Pull](pull.md)
* [Commit](commit.md)
* [Push](push.md)
